# LWJGL 2 to 3 Compatibility Layer

## Project Description:

This project aims to provide a compatibility layer between LWJGL 2 and LWJGL 3, allowing developers to seamlessly migrate their Minecraft mods or other LWJGL 2-based applications to the more modern and optimized LWJGL 3 without major changes to their existing codebase. The compatibility layer addresses the differences in APIs, structures, and functionalities between the two versions, ensuring smooth transition and compatibility.

Why This Project?

Minecraft, a popular pixel-based game with high freedom, has been using LWJGL 2 for its rendering and gaming functionalities. However, the LWJGL 2 version has been known for its outdated and suboptimal performance. With the release of LWJGL 3, which brings numerous performance improvements and modern features, migrating to LWJGL 3 becomes a desirable choice for Minecraft modders and developers. This compatibility layer bridges that gap, making the transition smoother and less time-consuming.

## Key Features:

1. Seamless Migration: The compatibility layer allows you to migrate your LWJGL 2-based code to LWJGL 3 with minimal changes, saving you time and effort.
2. API Compatibility: The layer maps LWJGL 2 APIs to their corresponding LWJGL 3 equivalents, ensuring that your existing code can work with the new version without modifications.
3. Performance Boost: LWJGL 3 brings significant performance improvements over LWJGL 2, meaning your Minecraft mods or applications will run smoother and more efficiently.
4. Open Source: The project is open-sourced on Github, allowing developers to contribute, improve, and customize the compatibility layer according to their needs.

## Getting Started:

To get started with the LWJGL 2 to 3 Compatibility Layer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: Visit the project's Github repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Integrate with Your Project: Replace the existing LWJGL 2 dependencies in your project with the provided compatibility layer.
3. Compile and Test: Compile your project and test it to ensure compatibility and functionality.
